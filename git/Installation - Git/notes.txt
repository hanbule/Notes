1 - To clone(download) repository from github to your local repository:
	git clone https://github.com/<username>/<rep_name>.git  // usually this https link can be copied from special github tab
	// ex: git clone https://github.com/altayaman/onlineshop_v1.git

2 - When we create a new repository on GitHub, wehave option to create README.md file, where md stands for markdown.
    This README.md files content shows up below the project code everytime we open the project on GitHub. 
    The styles and fonts in README.md can be manipulated just like in the IPython notebook markdown comments.

3 - We can add branches to the master branch of GitHub repository and use them separately so that nobody touches it except you. 
    And we can merge it to the master branch whenever we want.

4 - One git repository should include only one project.

5 - On GitHub you can use repositories for proects and gists for code snippets.
