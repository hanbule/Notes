1 - Locate to Eclipse project folder in terminal.
2 - Run command:
	git init
3 - Run command:
	git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git
	// ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/altayaman/onlineshop_v1.git

NOTE:
    if you want to correct/change remote name after setting it in above step 3:
	git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[otherUsername]/[otherReponame].git

    To check if it changed:
	git remote -v

4 - Run command:
	git add -A   # this adds all the files
5 - Run command:
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
6 - 
	git push origin master  // to specify that I meant the master branch of my repository

NOTE:
    If we use just 'GIT PUSH' command we have some warnings saying "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work ...", 
    in that case run command:
	git pull origin master  // to specify that I meant the master branch of my repository
    and again run:
	git push
