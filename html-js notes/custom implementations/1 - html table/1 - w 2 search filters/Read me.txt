Features:

#1
Html table with 2 types of search filters are implemented:
1 - including-AND search  (searches/shows any string value that contains all search values)
2 - including-OR search   (searches/shows any string value that contains at least one of search values)

#2
Table values (3rd column) are google-searchable on click.

#3
Datatable has 'TF Type' column (2nd column) that provides radio buttons for each row where one of two values (True, False) can be selected. 

#4
Each row has numbers and check box in order to keep a track of the row that you stopped on. Otherwise after scrolling table up and down many times, 
you might forget on which row you stopped or checking.

#5
When you close the table or refresh the page, it will give pop-up warning window so that you do not close/refresh your page.

#6
The whole datatable can be downloaded as csv file with changed 'TF Type' column.



Note:
The downside of such regular html tables is that  when rows count increases the harder it will be for your browser to open it.
