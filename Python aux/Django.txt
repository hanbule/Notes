# 1 
Create Django project:
	django-admin startproject <project name>

# 2
Start server:
	python <project name>/manage.py runserver

	127.0.0.1:8000


pip install mysqlclient
pip install MySQL-python



Note:
[1]
When starting django project, it may give error asking following:
	...
	Did you install mysqlclient or MySQL-python?
	(asking to install mysqlclient or MySQL-python)

I installed mysqlclient, and before that installed mysql server first and added 
export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin/:$PATH" to ~/.bash_profile.

[2]
Might need reset password:
#1 in terminal run:
	sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables

#2 then open new terminal window start mysql:
	mysql -u root

#3 execute followings:
	update mysql.user set authentication_string=password('moon') where user='root';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	quit
   close both windows and open new.

#4 now you can access mysql with new password:
	mysql -u root -p 
	<password>

[3]
Might need to set password timeout to never:
	mysql -u root -p
	<password>
	SELECT user, host, password_last_changed, password_lifetime, password_expired FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root';
	[might not allow to execute saying ALTER USER ..., just execute 'set password=pasword('moon');']
	ALTER USER root@localhost PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;

If you lose this password, please consult the section How to Reset the Root Password in the MySQL reference manual.
