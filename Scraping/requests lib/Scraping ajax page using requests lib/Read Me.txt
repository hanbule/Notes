# 1.1
# Open new tab in browser and open developer tools, shortest way is to right-click the clean area in new page and click 'Inspect'. 
# And Developer Tools will open up on right side in browser while left side will remain as your page opened.

# 1.2
# In open Developer Tools click 'Network' tab and there click the 'XHR' tab.
# And notice that the there is nothing in 'XHR' area, all you might see is the note that says 'Recordnig network activity ...' and smth else.

# 2.1
# Now, on left side of the browser where the webpage is, open the following link in browser:
	https://esquire.kz/category/lifestyle/

# 2.2
# And now you can see the page loaded on left side and columns like Name, Status, Type etc appeared in 'XHR' area,
# where you should see 2 elements loaded there.
# See the picture #1.

# 2.3
# Then scroll to the bottom of the page where you should see 'Load more' button. See picture #2.
# Notice that it is not pagination, it is a button that loads more content (next page content)
# and to load the next page from python code you will not find the link in href tag of 'Load more' button.
# It's because the next page is loaded by means of ajax request.
# So to scrape next page content we need to figure out what how ajax request gets next page content,
# in other words wee need to figure out: 
- what url is used by ajax
- what request method is used (Get or Post, for ajax it is usually Post method) by ajax
- what are the request body params by ajax

# 2.4
# To figure it out, now just click the 'Load more' button once and you will see new content loaded and 
# notice that one more new element appeared in 'XHR' area called 'admin-ajax.php'.
# In current example like in most cases, that is the element that will provide the answers e.g. ajax request details.
# See picture #3

# 2.5
# If you click on 'admin-ajax.php' you should see new window appeared with 4 sections where we are interested in 'General' and 'Form Data' sections
# where we will see Request URL, Request method in 'General' and request body 3 params in 'Form Data' section.
# See picture #4

# 3.1
# Now, we have only left to try to repeat the same ajax request in Postman first
# and then in python code where we use Scrapy in our example.


# 3.2
# open the Postman, create new request tab, 
- paste the Request URL in url bar
- choose POST request method on left side of url  bar
- click on 'Body' tab which is below the url bar and there choose 'form-data' where 3 columns appear (Key, Value, Description).
  Now copy-paste 3 params from 'Form Data' section in browser mentioned above in 2.5 to Key and values sections in Postman.
See picture #5


# 3.3
# And now just click the 'Send' button in Postman after which you should see loaded content of the next page.
# This is how we made ajaz request in Postman.
See picture #6

Now let's do the same ajax request in python code using Scrapy.
See the python code ajax_request_using_scrapy.py
Current code is written for python 2.7, delete first 5 lines in code to use it with python 3.x

# 4.2
Now let's do the same ajax request in python code using 'requests' library.
See the python code ajax_request_using_requests.py
Current code is written for python 2.7, delete first 5 lines in code to use it with python 3.x
