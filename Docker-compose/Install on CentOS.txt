Note:
    First, make sure docker is installed.

1
Download the latest version of Docker Compose:
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2
    sudo mv /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

    /usr/bin folder contains executable programs that are part of the operating system and installed by its package manager

3
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose

4
Check version:
    docker-compose --version

    Output: 
    docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880fe

To run docker-compose, go to folder with Dockerfile file and docker-compose file and run:
    sudo /usr/bin/docker-compose up

    sudo docker-compose up

5.2
To stop docker-compose running in background, go to folder with Dockerfile file and docker-compose file where you started docker-compose and run:
    sudo /usr/bin/docker-compose stop
