2.1
To run docker-compose, go to folder with Dockerfile file and docker-compose file and run:
    sudo docker-compose up

Note:
    And if you get error smth like:
        iptables: No chain/target/match error (with docker network create)	
    Run:
        systemctl restart docker
    That's because maybe something has deleted the docker iptables entries. 
    Docker will recreate them if you restart it (systemctl restart docker).
    You'll want to disable anything else that manages iptables to prevent this from happening in the future.


2.2
To stop docker-compose running in background, go to folder with Dockerfile file and docker-compose file where you started docker-compose and run:
    sudo docker-compose stop   # command will stop your containers, but it wonâ€™t remove them.
    or 
    sudo docker-compose down   # command will stop your containers, but it also removes the stopped containers 
    								    as well as any networks that were created.
